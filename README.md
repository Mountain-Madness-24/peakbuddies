## Overview

PeakBuddies App revolutionizes the way networking is conducted at hackathons. Inspired by the spontaneous interactions of the BeReal app, our platform aims to facilitate meaningful connections. By integrating an innovative approach where participants receive pings at predetermined times to meet others in random locations, we ensure an engaging and explorative networking experience. This method not only encourages participants to discover different parts of the venue but also adds an element of surprise to the networking process.

## The Problem

Networking at hackathons often lacks spontaneity and can feel intimidating or forced. Participants may find it challenging to connect with others in a meaningful way amid the hustle and bustle of the event.

## Our Solution: PeakBuddies

- **Speed Networking:** Just like speed dating, but for professional and creative connections. Participants exchange LinkedIn profiles, engage in timed interactions with conversation prompts, and have the opportunity to meet a wide array of individuals.
- **Explorative Meetups:** By utilizing an API for indoor location tracking, we ensure participants can easily find their meeting spots, encouraging exploration and making the networking experience enjoyable.
- **LinkedIn Integration:** Profiles feature LinkedIn information, relevant experience, and personal interests, making it easy to connect with and remember new acquaintances.
